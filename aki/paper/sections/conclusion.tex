\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed AXKI, an explainable AI framework for predicting postoperative acute kidney injury using vital signs and machine learning. The framework integrates four ML models with SHAP-based interpretability, achieving ROC-AUC of 0.82-0.84 while providing clinically meaningful explanations for predictions. The comprehensive evaluation on VitalDB dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of combining machine learning with explainable AI for postoperative AKI risk assessment. The framework addresses the critical need for both accurate prediction and clinical interpretability in medical AI applications, with potential for supporting clinical decision-making in postoperative care.

Future work will focus on multi-center validation, real-time deployment, and prospective clinical studies to further validate the framework's utility in clinical practice.
